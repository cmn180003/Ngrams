# Ngrams

Gain experience creating ngrams from text, build a language model from those ngrams, and reflect on the utility of our language model. We created and used bigram and unigram dictionaries from English, French, and Italian to calculate probabilities of each language against test data.
<br>This is our fourth assignment as a part of Professor Mazidi's Spring 2023 Human Language Technologies (Natural Language Processing) course at UTD.


- Training Files: [LangId.train.English](ngrams/LangId.train.English), [LangId.train.French](ngrams/LangId.train.French), [LangId.train.Italian](ngrams/LangId.train.Italian)
- Test File: [LangId.test](ngrams/LangId.test)
- Solution File: [LangId.sol](ngrams/LangId.sol)

- To run our project: 
  1. navigate to the folder "ngrams" and run "python3 ngrams1.py data" to create your unigram and bigram dictionaries based on the included training files
      (WARNING: this will take quite some time to complete, but just hang in there)
  2. run "python3 ngrams2.py" to test out the accuracy of your language model using the pickled dictionaries from the first program
