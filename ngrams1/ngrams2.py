'''
TO DO:
[X]- read in pickled dictionaries
[X]- for each line in test file:
    [X]- calculate probability for each language
    [X]- write language with highest probability to a file
[X]- compute and output accuracy as 'percentage of CORRECTLY CLASSIFIED
    instances in the test set' (check .sol file)
[X]- output your accuracy
[X]- output line numbers of incorrectly classified items
'''

'''
calculate probability for line language based on bigrams/unigrams dict
Args: string, dict{tuple(str, str): int}, dict{str: int}, list[str] 
    line of file, bi dict {bigram: count}, uni dict {uni: count}, hashset of vocab
Returns: double
    probability w/ laplace smoothing

    p_laplace = 1  # calculate p using Laplace smoothing

    for bigram in bigrams_test:

        d = uni_dict[bigram[0]] if bigram[0] in uni_dict else 0
        p_laplace = p_laplace * ((n + 1) / (d + V))

'''
Makes language model
Args:
    n/a
Returns: 
    n/a (writes to file with language guesses)
